[useTransform](https://motion.dev/docs/react-use-transform) used in Scene1, Scene2, Scene4 for animations. It transforms a value to another one instantly.

[motion.dev - useSpring](https://motion.dev/docs/react-use-spring), [motion.vueuse - useSpring](https://motion.vueuse.org/api/use-spring) used in Scene1 & Scene2 for fluid animations using the stiffness, damping and mass properties.
